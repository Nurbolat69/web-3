Student: Nurbolat Suleimenov
Group: se-2434

🎯 Objective

The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use modern CSS technologies such as Flexbox and Grid Layout.
The project represents a Nature Gallery website, designed with a consistent and natural color palette, smooth transitions, and responsive layout principles.

🧩 Task 0 — Navigation Bar (Main Page)

Created a stylish navigation bar using Flexbox. It includes links to all project pages (Task 1–4) and a logo.
The page contains a hero section with a background image of nature and a call-to-action button that leads to the gallery.

🧩 Task 1 — Nature Cards (Flexbox)

Developed a section with three nature-themed cards using Flexbox.
Each card includes an image, title, description, and button.
The layout automatically adjusts for different screen sizes.
Hover animations and shadows improve the design.

🧩 Task 2 — Grid Layout Page

Built a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid with defined areas: header, sidebar, main, and footer.
Each area has unique styling but shares the same color palette for harmony.
This task demonstrates mastery of CSS Grid properties.

🧩 Task 3 — Image Gallery (Grid)

Created a beautiful gallery of nature photos using CSS Grid.
The gallery automatically adapts to any screen width using auto-fit and minmax properties.
Hovering over an image slightly zooms it, adding interactivity.

🧩 Task 4 — Portfolio Page (Flex + Grid)

Combined Flexbox and Grid into a single responsive page.
It includes sections for header, sidebar, main content, and footer.
All components use the same natural theme to maintain consistency across the entire project.

🧠 Summary of Work Process

Designed the entire website structure with separate pages for each task.

Applied Flexbox for alignment and structure in Tasks 0 and 1.

Used CSS Grid for complex layouts in Tasks 2–4.

Chose a consistent natural color scheme (green, beige, brown) for a calm aesthetic.

Ensured responsive design for all screen sizes.

✅ Conclusion

This project helped me understand how Flexbox and Grid can be combined to build modern, flexible, and responsive websites.
I learned to create layouts that look beautiful on all devices while maintaining a clean, structured design.
