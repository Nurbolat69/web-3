The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use modern CSS technologies such as Flexbox and Grid Layout.
The project represents a Nature Gallery website, designed with a consistent and natural color palette, smooth transitions, and responsive layout principles.

 Task 0 — Navigation Bar (Main Page)

Created a stylish navigation bar using Flexbox. It includes links to all project pages (Task 1–4) and a logo.
The page contains a hero section with a background image of nature and a call-to-action button that leads to the gallery.

 Task 1 — Nature Cards (Flexbox)

Developed a section with three nature-themed cards using Flexbox.
Each card includes an image, title, description, and button.
The layout automatically adjusts for different screen sizes.
Hover animations and shadows improve the design.

 Task 2 — Grid Layout Page

Built a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid with defined areas: header, sidebar, main, and footer.
Each area has unique styling but shares the same color palette for harmony.
This task demonstrates mastery of CSS Grid properties.

 Task 3 — Image Gallery (Grid)

Created a beautiful gallery of nature photos using CSS Grid.
The gallery automatically adapts to any screen width using auto-fit and minmax properties.
Hovering over an image slightly zooms it, adding interactivity.

 Task 4 — Portfolio Page (Flex + Grid)

Combined Flexbox and Grid into a single responsive page.
It includes sections for header, sidebar, main content, and footer.
All components use the same natural theme to maintain consistency across the entire project.

 Summary of Work Process

Designed the entire website structure with separate pages for each task.

Applied Flexbox for alignment and structure in Tasks 0 and 1.

Used CSS Grid for complex layouts in Tasks 2–4.

Chose a consistent natural color scheme (green, beige, brown) for a calm aesthetic.

Ensured responsive design for all screen sizes.

✅ Conclusion

This project helped me understand how Flexbox and Grid can be combined to build modern, flexible, and responsive websites.
I learned to create layouts that look beautiful on all devices while maintaining a clean, structured design.
